### **1. (a)** Find the parametric equations of the tangent line to the following curves:
i. $\vec{r}(t) = \ln{t}\hat{i} + e^{-t}\hat{j} + t^{3}\hat{k}; t_{0}=2$
ii. $\vec{r}(t) = 2\cos{\pi t}\hat{i} + 2\sin{\pi t}\hat{j} + 3t\hat{k}; t_{0}=\frac{1}{3}$.

**(b)** Find the vector parallel to the line of intersection of the two planes $3x-6y-2z=15$ and $2x+y-2z=5$.

**(c)** Find the velocity and acceleration of $\vec{r}(t) = 3t\hat{i} + \sin{t}\hat{j} + t^{2}\hat{k}$ as a function of $\theta(t)$. Also, plot the graph of $\theta(t)$ versus t.

### **2. (a)** Find the tangent vectors to the plane curve C defined by the vector function $\vec{r}(t) = 5\cos{t}\hat{i} + 4\sin{t}\hat{j}$ at the points where $t=\frac{\pi}{4}$ and $t=\pi$. Make a sketch of C, and display the position vectors $\vec{r}(\frac{\pi}{4})$ and $\vec{r}(\pi)$, and the tangent vectors $\vec{r}'(\frac{\pi}{4})$ and $\vec{r}'(\pi)$.

**(b)** A bug walks along the trunk of a tree following a path modeled by the circular helix $\vec{r}(t) = \langle \cos{t}, \sin{t}, t \rangle$.
Find the arc length parameterization of the circular helix while starting the bug at the reference point (1,0,0).
Also, compute the bug's final coordinates when the bug walks up the helix for a distance of 10 units and graphically show the obtained results.

### **3. (a)**

i. $\vec{r}(t) = e^{t}\hat{i} + e^{t}\cos{t}\hat{j} + e^{t}\sin{t}\hat{k}; t=0$
ii. $\vec{r}(t) = 2\cos{t}\hat{i} + 3\sin{t}\hat{j}$; $0 \le t \le 2\pi$
Also, plot the graphs of $K(t)$ and hence comment on the obtained results.

Also, establish the identity $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$ if possible.

**(c)** Suppose that $w = \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}$, $x=\cos{\theta}$, $y=\sin{\theta}$, $z=\tan{\theta}$. Use chain rule to find $\frac{dw}{d\theta}$ when $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$.
